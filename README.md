Description:
This is a simple game where the goal is to destroy all of the aliens. I wanted to make a game because I think coding, art, and games is what I find inspires me the most. I love playing video games, coding, and entertaining people so I might as well make a video game. 

Process:
At first, I was trying to make a choose-your-adventure game, but in the end, I chose to do a RPG game because it seemed to be more fun to do. I started by learning the tutorial “Ruby’s Adventure: 2D Beginner.” After I got the hang of coding each character and the different parts of making a game, I started to try to do my own things. I started by changing the pathfinding of the aliens from only horizontal or only vertical to be able to follow the player. Also, I created a health bar for the aliens and made the bullets do damage specifically to the aliens. Afterwards I just made my own sprites and textures and used other tutorials to find how to rotate the alien toward the direction of the player and how to make the player go through different scenes by touching a game object which in my case is a door. Each scene is a different level that I created.
